# Utilizing Machine Learning and Image Processing to automate brain tumor detection process 

Tumor is an uncontrolled growth of tissues in any part of the body. Tumors are of different types and hence they have different treatments. Detection of tumor in the earlier stages makes the treatment possible.    

In this project, we aim to build a CNN architecture which gives higher accuracy compared to the existing and standard models.
ML project on Brain Tumor Detection. (custom model) Train Accuracy: 82.2% Test Accuracy: 77.46% 



# The Main objectives of this project are

• Build a model which gives higher accuracy than the standard models
• Compare the accuracies with the standard models
• Use the various CNN layers and experiment with it in order to increase the accuracy
• Build a model which is different from the standard model
• Use two different datasets, having different number of images in order to compare which dataset gives higher accuracy
• For the given image, predict the class
